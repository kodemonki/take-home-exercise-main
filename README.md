# Web Team Candidate Assessment

This repo contains three separate assessments. Your recruiter will let you know which one to complete. You are only required to complete the assessment that you are assigned. You can disregard any code or instructions that are not relevant to your assessment.

## Privacy

This assessment is not open source. Please do not fork or share your solution publicly in any way.

You may store and work on your solution in GitHub as a **private repository**, but please **submit your solution as a zip file**.

You can submit your solution by emailing the zip file to your recruiting specialist.

> **Note** - when zipping your solution, make sure you exclude the `node_modules` and `dist` directories from your zip file, or it may be too large to send via email.
